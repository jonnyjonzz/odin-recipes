                <ul>
                    <li>8 ounces flat rice noodles</li>
                    <li>3 Tablespoons oil</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu, cut into small pieces</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup of bean sprouts</li>
                    <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                    <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
                    <li>2 limes</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of fresh cilantro</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
                    <li>Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Stir Fry:: Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.
                    <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.
                    <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.
                    <li>Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
                    <li>Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.</li>
                </ol>
